        <h2>Backtracking</h2>

        <p>
            Backtracking is brute force algorithm. It can be used to find solution to wide range of problems, not only sudoku.
            From development point of view, it is probably the easiest approach of finding sudoku solution.
            But it is also least effective in terms of computing time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sudoku below was constructed specifically to mess with backtracking algorithm. Huge number of iterations are
            needed to find the solution with backtracking. Naive approach, where all numbers 1 to 9 are tried on all
            empty squares requires almost 70 million boards to be evaluated, until solution is find.
        </p>

        <h3>Naive backtracking implementation</h3>

        <p>Let's see, how quickly we can find a solution:</p>

        <div id="backtracking-main">
            <div id="backtracking-original-sudoku" class="original-sudoku"></div>
            <div id="backtracking-solved-sudoku" class="solved-sudoku">
                <button id="backtracking-start">Solve</button>
            </div>
            <div id="backtracking-stats"></div>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Backtracking implementation with bit boards</h3>

        <p>
            And now, same backtracking algorithm, same number of boards is evaluated. But we use more efficient internal
            representation. Instead of traversing array and searching if given number is already placed in row/column/box,
            we use bit boards. As a result, we can find solution two times faster.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note, that we still didn't implement any heuristics to narrow search space. We still check all 70 millions
            of boards until we find solution. But thanks to efficient implementation, we can do it much faster.
